We hypothesized that variability in neural spike time precision (jitter) and reliability may encode features of sound. Single-unit activity was isolated from rat auditory cortex during presentation of sounds of varying rhythms and temporal shapes. We found that jitter varied with temporal shape and reliability varied with rhythmic frequency. Study was conducted at the University of Connecticut from 2012-2015.

#### Experimental methods: 
- Multiunit recording

#### Data processing methods: 
- Single-unit isolation ([spike sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_sorting))
- Signal autocorrelation
- Model fitting
- Peristimulus spike time histogram
