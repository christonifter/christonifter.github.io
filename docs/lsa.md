We investigated an unusual pattern of neural activity triggered by prolonged exposure to intense sound. We recorded multi-unit activity from the mouse inferior colliculus (auditory midbrain). Data was collected at the UConn Health from 2019-2021.

Experimental methods: 
- multiunit recordings
- auditory brainstem responses

Data processing methods: 
- Peristimulus Spike Time Histogram
- Digital signal processing
