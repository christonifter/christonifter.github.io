We investigated an [unusual pattern of neural activity](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep20757) triggered by prolonged exposure to intense sound. We recorded multi-unit activity from the mouse inferior colliculus (auditory midbrain). Data was collected at the UConn Health from 2019-2021.

#### Experimental methods: 
- Multiunit recordings
- Auditory brainstem responses

#### Data processing methods: 
- Peristimulus spike time histogram
- Digital signal processing
