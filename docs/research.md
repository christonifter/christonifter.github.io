# Neural coding

Neural coding is the representation of information in natural brains. I have studied and tested questions in the auditory system of rats and mice. This system provides a model of sensory coding in the mammalian brain. Sensory coding studies ask how the environmental signals can be represented and processed in the brain. Just as a word can be translated from one language to another, sounds are transduced from physical energy to neural action potentials in the inner ear. Furthermore, these action potentials are sent to multiple centers in the brain, and the spike timing patterns change in each of these centers. These changes in these spike patterns may be related to the way we perceive sound.

# Synaptic plasticity

Synaptic plasticity is the ability of the connections between neurons to change. Like the ability to add, follow, and unfollow people on social media, neurons can strengthen or weaken their connections to other neurons. One of the most well understood rules that govern how connections are modified is the Hebbian rule, which proposes: neurons that fire together, wire together. However, synapses also change even when neurons don't fire together. This plasticity is important to maintain efficient coding and processing when sensory input changes, and may be involved in tinnitus.
