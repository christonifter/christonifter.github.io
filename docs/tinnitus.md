Our aim is to find an objective measure that can discriminate people with and without tinnitus. We recorded [auditory brainstem responses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_brainstem_response) from participants who experience tinnitus, and participants who do not. We created a mouse model of tinnitus, to compare the behavior of individual neurons between mice with and without tinnitus. Data was collected at the UConn Health from 2019-2022. 

Experimental methods: 
- High intensity sound induction of tinnitus in mice
- Human psychoacoustics
- Auditory brainstem responses in humans and mice
- Multiunit recordings in mice

Data processing methods: 
- Digital signal processing
- Singular value decomposition
- Bootstrapping
