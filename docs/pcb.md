Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are enduring environmental toxicants and causes many adverse health effects, including losses in hearing sensitivity. In this study, we found changes in neural connectivity in the auditory cortex of
rats exposed to PCBs during development. Study was conducted at the University of Illinois from 2016-2018. 

Experimental methods: 
- Rat husbandry
- Developmental administration of PCBs
- Auditory brainstem response
- Laser scanning photostimulation

Data processing methods: 
- Two sample means comparison
- image rotation
