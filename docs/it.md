Associative Hebbian-type synaptic plasticity underlies the mechanisms of learning and memory; however, Hebbian learning rules lead to runaway dynamics of synaptic weights and lack mechanisms for synaptic competition. We found that delivering a high frequency pulse train of current ([intracellular tetanization](https://volgushev.lab.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2605/2020/01/Volgushev_Neuroreport1994v5p2069.pdf), IT) to neurons in the auditory cortex can induce plasticity of its synaptic inputs. This plasticity violates Hebbian rules of synaptic plasticity, and indicates that the auditory cortex contains mechanisms for heterosynaptic plasticity. Heterosynaptic plasticity may serve to normalize synaptic weights during associative learning. Study conducted at the University of Connecticut from 2009-2012.
