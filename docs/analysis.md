# Psychophysical testing

Psychophysics relates a person's perception to physical measurements. Psychophysical measurements were taken from study participants at UConn Health. The test battery included frequency-intensity audibility curves, pitch matching, and auditory discomfort tests. In all tests, sounds were presented to a participant, and the participant provided feedback through a USB volume controller knob. PsyAud is a user interface written in MATLAB, which allows the experimenters to manage and monitor the psychophysical tests.

# Visualizing and measuring auditory brainstem responses

The Auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a standard method for measuring the brain's response to sound, using scalp electrodes. This can be used to measure hearing thresholds in populations with difficulty communicating feedback, such as infants and other animals.
